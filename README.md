# linked-list

This Linked List project is a part of the Odin Project curriculum and put my recent learning of linked lists to the test. The project was relatively basic and required me to create a node class and linked list class that contained class functions. The goal was to build a variety of noted functions that could perform certain actions on my created linked list. Although I said this project was basic, it was still challenging to figure out how to build each of the class functions.

Although this project was meant to just exist in the console, I decided to take it a step further and build a UI for my logic to make this project more interactive. I figured this would have multiple benefits, like giving me more practice on HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation in JS while also being more user-friendly to anyone who may view and test out my linked-list repository in the future. 

I remain a strong proponent of the idea that a majority of my learning occurs during projects. It can sometimes be hard to truly understand something while reading over material and watching videos. It's when I get to the projects that everything I learned begins to click into place. I have a lot more confidence with linked lists now than I had going into this project and am looking forward to building on this confidence and knowledge.
